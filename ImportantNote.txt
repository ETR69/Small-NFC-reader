Read this note, please:

1) From schematic you will soldering only C12 and NOT C11 ; its value is 560pF
2) C10 and C13 are OPEN (no solder any Capacitors);
3) X1 (crystal unit) was mirrored on pcb. My fault! Please rotate the component of 90Â° (correct in the new gerber version!)

I have correct X1 (crystal unit) pcb footprint.
Please download "Small-NFC-reader_correct.zip" Gerber files.
