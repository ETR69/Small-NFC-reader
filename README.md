# Small-NFC-reader
NFC ISO/IEC 15693 reader  20 x 20 mm
Please, download "Small-NFC-reader_correct.zip" file if you want to realize it.
I test SPI communication with Arduino UNO and with BLUNO NANO V1.3 and works. Uart is also available.
This Small-NFC-reader reads data up to 4-5 mm far from sensor. Maybe it can be improved....
Feel free to copy/modify this design.
